# Protein Representation

||X-ray|NMR|EM|
|---|---|---|---|
|Required sample amount|Large|Smaller than X-ray|Smaller than X-ray|
|Required sample properties|1. Absolute homogenuity<br> 2. Easy to form crystal and regular lattice|||
|Sample preparation|Requires growing crystals|Isotopic labelling|1. Negative staining EM: Heavy atom staining<br> 2. Cryo EM: Quick frozen using liquid nitrogen|
|Resolution|Highest|N/A|High, but lower than X-ray|
|Imaging property|Captures a single snapshoot of proteins in the lowest energy conformation|Represents relative positions of protons|Imaging proteins approximating the physiological status in aqueous environment|

## X-ray

Scatter positions$\rightarrow$Lattice parameters (how proteins are arranged in a crystal)
Scatter intensity$\rightarrow$The arrangement of atoms/electrons

### Phase Problem

Solution: Molecular replacement or Isomorphous replacement.

## Electron Microscopic

### NS-EM
- Higher contrast
- Staining using heavy metal salts, which may change the protein spatial structures
- Lower resolution
### Cryo-EM
- Lower contrast
- More close to the natural conformation
- Higher resolution

Samples are not firmly fixed in ice. This is attributed to
1. Freezing sample quickly to avoid the formation of solid lattice 
2. The emitted electron beams raise local energy and induce motions

Introducing Fab domain:
1. increasing subunit size for a better contrast
2. Introducing asymmetricity

## Small Angle X-ray Scatter

Low resolution, only being used to glimpse protein overall shapes.

## IM-MS

Proteins are accelerated in a magnetic field and inert gas environment. Their immigration rates depend on aerodynamic resistances and surface areas.
